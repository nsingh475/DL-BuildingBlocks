# Avoid Over-Fitting

Some basic terms:
1. Bias: Bias is a prediction error that is introduced in the model due to oversimplifying the machine learning algorithms. Or it is the difference between the predicted values and the actual values.
2. Variance: If the machine learning model performs well with the training dataset, but does not perform well with the test dataset, then variance occurs.

#### Overfitting
It occurs when the model has been overtrained or when it contains too much complexity, resulting in high error rates on test data.
It has high variance and low bias.

#### How to avoid the Overfitting in Model
Following are the ways to avoid overfitting:
1. Cross-Validation
2. Training with more data
3. Removing features
4. Early stopping the training
5. Regularization
6. Ensembling
